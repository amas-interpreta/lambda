lambda
======

WORK IN PROGRESS.

Ability to run AWS lambda functions on IronWorker.

This is a placeholder repository. It is likely that the functionality here will
be moved to `gorunner` and/or `swapi` and/or `ironcli`.

Based on [previous work](https://github.com/vlopatkin/iron-lambda) by Vitaly Lopatkin.

At some point, once we have the tests running all the time on IronWorker, we
can get rid of the tests in this repo.
